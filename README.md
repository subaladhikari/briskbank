A static website for a virtual bank with member login and basic account transactions functionality. <br>
# _[SEE LIVE](https://subaladhikari.github.io/briskbank/)_

## Tools

The landing page for the site is built with Bootstrap 5 beta2.<br>
The member login page is built with plain HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS.

## Release History
* v1
    * _For live demo, please visit: [https://subaladhikari.github.io/briskbank/](https://subaladhikari.github.io/briskbank/)_
* v2
    * Fully built using Bootstrap - Nearly completed.
    * New functionality for registraion - Work in progress.

## Development
I built this project while brushing up my skills on plain JS. After finishing the member functionality, I thought about making a landing page. Due to this reason, the member login page is built on plain JS while the landing page is with Bootstrap. Soon I will release the fully bootstrap built version and deploy it.
